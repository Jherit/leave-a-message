# leave-a-message
Looks like live chat... it's not. Just a dumb message form made into a Wordpress plugin.
:warning: **WARNING!** :warning: This plugin has been installed and is in use on one wordpress site currently. You will probably need to tinker with the code to get it working on your WP site.
